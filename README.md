# Suspension Degradation Project

Data-driven study of vehicle suspension degradation using real-world driving measurements and finite element modeling. The project compares experimental signals with FEM predictions to understand fatigue behavior and highlight gaps between simulation and reality.

## Project Structure

- `01_problem_definition` – scope and objectives  
- `02_physical_system` – system description and assumptions  
- `03_instrumentation` – sensor selection and placement  
- `04_data_collection` – driving conditions and logging (raw data excluded)  
- `05_data_processing` – filtering, cycle counting, feature extraction  
- `06_fem_model` – geometry, materials, boundary conditions  
- `07_comparison` – metrics and model vs measurement comparison  
- `08_results_and_discussion` – lessons learned  
- `09_documentation` – GitHub + article drafts  
- `10_cv_translation` – portfolio presentation notes  

## Notes

Raw measurement data and FEM binaries are intentionally excluded. Folder structure and documentation are provided for reproducibility and learning purposes.
